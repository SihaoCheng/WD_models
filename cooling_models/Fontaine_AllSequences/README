Three distinct families of DA models are available:

1) A set of 21 evolutionary sequences referring to pure C-core models
with standard "thick" H and He layers, i.e., with log M(H)/M* = -4.0
and log M(He)/M* = -2.0. Hence the notation C_0200204 for the sequence
with M* = 0.2 Msun, etc. These sequences are similar except for the
value of the total mass (21 values between 0.2 and 1.3 Msun). These
are the sequences published in Fontaine, Brassard, & Bergeron (2001,
PASP, 113, 409).

2) A set of 16 evolutionary sequences for mixed C/O core composition
(50/50 by mass fraction mixed uniformly) and for standard "thick" H and
He layers. The notation is CO_0200204 for the sequence with M* = 0.2
Msun, etc. There are 16 different values of the total mass, again
between 0.2 and 1.3 Msun. 

3) A similar set of 16 evolutionary sequences for *mixed* C/O core
composition (50/50 by mass fraction mixed uniformly), but for "thin" H
layers with log M(H)/M* = -10.0 instead of -4.0.

The C_ files have headers that should be self-explanatory, while the
CO_ files do not have such headers, but the format is identical
to that of the C_ files. A sample header is provided in the file
SampleHeader.
